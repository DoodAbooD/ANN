# ANN
A basic artificial neural network written in C++ using the minimum amount of external libraries (At the time, only the standard math.h and iostream.h libraries are used)
This is a work in progress, it's currently capable of creating simple neural networks with basic functionality, such as learning 
AND/OR gates logic.. 
I'm looking to further extend its complexity, allowing it to be used for more advanced applications.
I'm using Arrays of pointers (Sometimes arrays of pointers to pointers) throughout the project, I realize vectors are a much better substitute, might implement that later.
Only Sigmoid activation function is currently implemented, I'm looking to add more functions in the future. 
All implementations are in the nn.cpp file.
